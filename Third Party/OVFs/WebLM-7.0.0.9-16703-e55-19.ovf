AVAYA GLOBAL SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
REVISED:  March 2015

THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS") GOVERNS THE USE OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE LICENSED THROUGH AVAYA. READ THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS CAREFULLY, IN THEIR ENTIRETY, BEFORE INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE (AS DEFINED IN SECTION A BELOW). BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZING OTHERS TO DO SO, YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND THE ENTITY FOR WHOM YOU ARE DOING SO (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO INTERCHANGEABLY AS "YOU," "YOUR," AND "END USER"), AGREE TO THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND CREATE A BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND AVAYA INC. OR THE APPLICABLE AVAYA AFFILIATE ("AVAYA"). IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY OR DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS, YOU MUST RETURN OR DELETE THE SOFTWARE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF DELIVERY FOR A REFUND OF THE FEE, IF ANY, YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSE OR IF SOFTWARE IS ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS OR THE EQUIVALENT OPTION.

A. Definitions
(i) "Affiliate" means any entity that is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Avaya Inc. or End User. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the power to direct the management and policies of such party, directly or indirectly, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing. 

(ii) "Documentation" means information published in varying mediums which may include product information, operating instructions and performance specifications that are generally made available to users of products. Documentation does not include marketing materials. 

(iii) "Software" means  computer programs in object code, provided by Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, whether as stand-alone products or pre-installed on hardware products, and any upgrades, updates, patches, bug fixes, or modified versions thereto.

B. Scope. These Software License Terms are applicable to anyone who installs, downloads, and/or uses Software and/or Documentation, obtained from Avaya or an Avaya reseller, distributor, direct partner, system integrator, service provider or other partner authorized to provide Software to End Users in the applicable territory ( collectively "Avaya Channel Partner"). Some or all of the Software may be remotely hosted or accessible to You through the Internet. You are not authorized to use the Software if the Software was obtained from anyone other than Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner. 
These Software License Terms govern Your use of the Software and/ or Documentation except to the extent: (i) You are obtaining the Software directly from Avaya and You have a separate, written agreement with Avaya governing Your use of the Software, signed within three (3) years of the purchase of the applicable Software license, (ii) You are obtaining the Software from an Avaya Channel Partner and You have a separate, written agreement with Avaya governing Your use of Software obtained from that Avaya Channel Partner, signed within three (3) years of the purchase of the applicable Software license, 
(iii) the Software is accompanied by a Shrinkwrap License, or (iv) the Software is governed by Third Party Terms. If You have a separate signed purchase agreement with Avaya, as set forth in (i) or (ii) above, such agreement shall take precedence over these Software License Terms to the extent of any conflict. With respect to third party elements subject to a Shrinkwrap License or other Third Party Terms, the Shrinkwrap License or other Third Party Terms shall take precedence over any signed agreement with Avaya and these Software License Terms to the extent of any conflict. 

C. License Grant. Avaya grants You a personal, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Software and associated Documentation obtained from Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, and for which applicable fees have been paid, for Your internal business purposes at the indicated capacity and features and within the scope of the applicable license types described below and at locations where the Software is initially installed. Licenses provided under this Agreement are for a perpetual duration, unless (i) otherwise specified in the order or (ii) the license is provided as part of a service or subscription, in which case the license grant will be limited to the duration specified on the order or in the service or subscription Documentation. Documentation shall be used only in support of the authorized use of the associated Software. Software installed on mobile-devices and clients, such as a laptop or mobile phone, may be used outside of the country where the Software was originally installed, provided that such use is on a temporary basis only.

(i) Right to Move License Entitlements. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation permitting use of the Software only at the location where it is initially installed, You may move eligible right to use license entitlements ("RTU") for certain specified Software from one location to another in accordance with Avaya’s then-current software license portability policy ("License Portability Policy"), which License Portability Policy is available upon request, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section C (i):

(a) You shall provide written notice within ten (10) days to Avaya of any RTU moves including but not limited to, the number and type of licenses moved, the location of the original Server and the location of the new Server, the date of such RTU moves and any other information that Avaya may reasonably request; 

(b) You  may only move RTU’s to and from Designated Processors or Servers supporting the same Software application;

(c) You must reduce the quantity of the licenses on the original Server by the number of RTU’s being moved to the new Server;

(d) You acknowledge that: (1) You may be charged additional fees when moving RTU’s as per Avaya’s then-current License Portability Policy, (2) maintenance services do not cover system errors caused by moves not performed by Avaya, (3) You are responsible for any programming, administration, design assurance, translation or other activity to make sure the Software will scale and perform as specified as a result of any license moves, and if any such transfer results in a requirement for Avaya system engineering or requires the use of on-site Avaya personnel, You will be charged the Time and Materials fees for such activity; 

(e) If Your maintenance coverage differs on licenses on the same product instance at the location of the new Server, service updates, recasts and/or fees may apply and any fee adjustments for differences in coverage will only be made on a going forward basis as of the date Avaya receives notice of the RTU move; and

(f) You may move RTU’s from one Affiliate to another Affiliate provided that You comply with all of the conditions of this Section, including, without limitation, providing the name and address of the new Affiliate in Your written notice under subpart (a) above, and provided such new Affiliate agrees to be bound by these Software License Terms. 

(ii) Non-Production License Grant. With respect to Software distributed by Avaya to You for non-production purposes, the scope of the license granted herein shall be to use the Software in a non-production environment solely for testing or other non-commercial purposes on a single computer  or as otherwise designated by Avaya ("Non-Production License").

D. All Rights Reserved. Avaya or its licensors retain title to and ownership of the Software, Documentation, and any modifications or copies thereof. Except for the limited license rights expressly granted in these Software License Terms, Avaya or its licensors reserve all rights, including without limitation copyright, patent, trade secret, and all other intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and Documentation and any modifications or copies thereof. The Software contains trade secrets of Avaya, its suppliers, or licensors, including but not limited to the specific design, structure and logic of individual Software programs, their interactions with other portions of the Software, both internal and external, and the programming techniques employed.

E. General License Restrictions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, You agree not to: (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, reverse translate or in any other manner decode the Software; (ii) alter, modifandy or create any derivative works or enhancements, adaptations, or translations of the Software or Documentation; (iii) sell, sublicense, lease, rent, loan, assign, convey or otherwise transfer the Software or Documentation except as expressly authorized by Avaya in writing, and any attempt to do so is void; (iv) distribute, disclose or allow use of the Software or Documentation, in any format, through any timesharing service, service bureau, network or by any other similar means, such as hosting or cloud, except as expressly authorized by Avaya in writing; (v) allow any service provider or other third party, with the exception of Avaya’s authorized maintenance providers who are acting solely on behalf of and for the benefit of End User, to use or execute any software commands that facilitate the maintenance or repair of any product; (vi) gain access to or the use of any Software or part thereof without authorization from Avaya; (vii) enable or activate, or cause, permit or allow others to enable or activate any logins reserved for use by Avaya or Avaya’s authorized maintenance providers; (viii) publish the results of any tests run on the Software; 
(ix) disclose, provide, or otherwise make available to any third party any trade secrets contained in the Software or Documentation; (x) use the Software in a virtualized environment except as expressly authorized by these Software License Terms, or (xi) permit or encourage any third party to do any of the foregoing.

End User agrees not to allow anyone other than its authorized employees, agents or representatives who have a need to use the Software or Documentation to have access to the Software or Documentation. End User agrees to inform any third party to whom You give access to the Software or Documentation of these Software License Terms and shall obligate such third party to comply with such terms and provisions. End User shall be responsible for any third party’s failure to comply with these Software License Terms and shall indemnify Avaya for any damages, loss, expenses or costs, including attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, incurred by Avaya as a result of non-compliance with this Section.
Additional License Restrictions Applicable to the EU. Notwithstanding the limitations in Sections C and E, solely to the extent an End User’s resale rights cannot be precluded or restricted by mandatory applicable law, End Users located in a member state of the European Union may resell licenses subject to the following conditions:

(i) Prior to resale of a license, End User will promptly, but not less than 30 days prior to a resale, notify Avaya in writing of its intention to resell a license.

(ii) Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, End User will not be permitted to resell less than its entire license to a buyer.

(iii) End User will resell the Software subject to these Software License Terms and shall  ensure that the buyer is bound by these Software License Terms.

(iv) Upon resale of a license, End User shall immediately and permanently cease all use of and destroy all copies of the Software and any related materials in End User’s possession or control and, upon Avaya’s request, certify such destruction in writing. Avaya may audit End User’s compliance with the foregoing in accordance with Section J below.

(v) End User will keep appropriate records of all license resale including, but not limited to, the name and location of the buyer and the number and types of licenses resold. 

(vi) End User acknowledges that: (a) resale of a license is subject to any relevant Third Party Terms; (b) maintenance services do not cover system errors caused by license resale not performed by Avaya; (c) Avaya is not responsible for any programming, administration, design assurance, translation or other activity to make sure the Software will scale and perform as specified as a result of any license resale, and if any such resale results in a requirement for Avaya system engineering or requires the use of on-site Avaya personnel, End User will be charged the then applicable Avaya time and materials rates for such activity; (d) any resale of a maintenance services agreement between Avaya and the original licensee is subject to Avaya’s prior written approval. Avaya reserves the right to withhold such approval and/or offer the new licensee a maintenance services agreement subject to different terms and conditions; and 

(e) if not expressly agreed by Avaya in writing otherwise, the resale of licenses does not entitle the End User to cancel or partially cancel a maintenance services agreement during the agreed term.

If the Software is rightfully located in a member state of the European Union and End User needs information about the Software in order to achieve interoperability of an independently created software program with the Software, End User will first request such information from Avaya. Avaya may charge End User a reasonable fee for the provision of such information. End User agrees to protect such information in accordance with Section P below, and shall use such information only in accordance with the terms and conditions under which Avaya provides such information. To the extent that the End User is expressly permitted by applicable mandatory law to undertake any activities related to achieving interoperability of an independently created software program with the Software, End User will not exercise those rights until End User has given Avaya twenty (20) days written notice of its intent to exercise any such rights.

F. Proprietary Rights Notices. You agree to retain, in the same form and location, all proprietary legends and/or logos of Avaya and/or Avaya’s suppliers on any permitted copies of the Software or Documentation.

G. Backup Copies. End User may create a reasonable number of archival and backup copies of the Software and the Documentation.

H. Upgrades. End User’s right to use any upgrades to the Software shall be conditioned upon End User having a valid license to use the original Software and paying the applicable license fee to Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner for such upgrade.

I. Warranty. Avaya’s Global Product Warranty Policy for End Users, which details a limited warranty for Software and Software media and the applicable procedures, exclusions, and disclaimers, is available through the following website: http://support.avaya.com, or such successor site as designated by Avaya. Please note that if You are acquiring the Software from an Avaya Channel Partner outside the United States of America or Canada, any warranty is provided to You by said Avaya Channel Partner and not by Avaya.

J. Compliance. Avaya and the Avaya Channel Partner who provided the Software have the right to inspect or audit by remote polling or other reasonable means, and to inspect End User’s books, records, and accounts during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, to determine End User’s compliance with these Software License Terms, including but not limited to usage levels. In the event such inspection or audit uncovers non-compliance with these Software License Terms, then without prejudice to Avaya’s termination rights hereunder, End User shall promptly pay Avaya any applicable license fees. End User agrees to keep a current record of the location of the Software.

K. Termination of License; Effect of Termination/ Expiration. If You breach these Software License Terms and if within ten (10) business days of Avaya’s written request to cure, You have not cured all breaches of license limitations or restrictions, Avaya may, with immediate effect, terminate the licenses granted in these Software License Terms without prejudice to any available rights and remedies Avaya may have at law or in equity. Upon termination or expiration of the license for any reason, You must immediately destroy all copies of the Software and any related materials in Your possession or control and, upon Avaya’s request, certify such destruction in writing. The provisions concerning confidentiality, the protection of trade secrets and proprietary rights, license restrictions, export control, and all limitations of liability and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty (as well as any other terms which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination) will survive any termination or expiration of the Software License Terms.

L. License Types. Avaya grants You a license within the scope of the license types described below, with the exception of Heritage Nortel Software, for which the scope of the license is detailed in Section M below. Where the order documentation does not expressly identify a license type, the applicable license will be a Designated System License. The applicable number of licenses and units of capacity for which the license is granted will be one (1), unless a different number of licenses or units of capacity is specified in the documentation or other materials available to You.

V. Miscellaneous. These Software License Terms and any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Software License Terms ("Dispute"), including without limitation those relating to the formation, interpretation, breach or termination of these Software License Terms, or any issue regarding whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration under these Software License Terms, will be governed by New York State laws, excluding conflict of law principles, and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. 
Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the following provisions. The disputing party shall give the other party written notice of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve each Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longer period as the parties may mutually agree, following the delivery of such notice, by negotiations between designated representatives of the parties who have dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States cannot be settled under these procedures and within these timeframes, it will be conclusively determined upon request of either party by a final and binding arbitration proceeding to be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross claims and counterclaims by any one party against any or all other parties exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a panel of three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to award compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of these Software License Terms and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. The arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or otherwise modify the terms of these Software License Terms. The ruling by the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their assets. The parties will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)’ fees, but each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The parties, their representatives, other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and results of the arbitration shall be as limited and narrowed as required to comply with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award only, the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be disclosed. 

If a Dispute by one party against the other that arose in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth above, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Except as otherwise stated above with regard to arbitration of Disputes that arise anywhere other than in the United States or are based upon an alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States, each party to these Software License Terms consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts, including their appellate courts, for the purpose of all actions and proceedings.

The parties agree that the arbitration provision in this section may be enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or order. Nothing in this section will be construed to preclude either party from seeking provisional remedies, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its rights pending arbitration, at any time. In addition and notwithstanding the foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take any necessary legal action at any time, including without limitation seeking immediate injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect Avaya’s intellectual property and its confidential or proprietary information (including but not limited to trade secrets).

If any provision of these Software License Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, these Software License Terms will not be rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and the provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision within the limits of applicable law. The failure to assert any rights under the Software License Terms, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate in the event of breach or default, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each and every provision of the Software License Terms in accordance with their terms. If you move any Software, and as a result of such move, a jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including withholding taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any such Software), then you are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any such duty, taxes, levy or other fees. 

W. Agreement in English. The parties confirm that it is their wish that these Software License Terms, as well as all other documents relating hereto, including all notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the English language only. Les parties aux pr&#xE9;sentes confirment leur volont&#xE9; que cette convention, de m&#xE9;me que tous les documents, y compris tout avis, qui s'y rattachent, soient r&#xE9;dig&#xE9;s en langue anglaise.
