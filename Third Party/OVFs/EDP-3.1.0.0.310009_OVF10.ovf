REVISED:  March 2015

THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS") GOVERNS THE 
USE OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE LICENSED 
THROUGH AVAYA. READ THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS CAREFULLY, IN THEIR 
ENTIRETY, BEFORE INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE (AS 
DEFINED IN SECTION A BELOW). BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE 
SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZING OTHERS TO DO SO, YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND 
THE ENTITY FOR WHOM YOU ARE DOING SO (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO 
INTERCHANGEABLY AS "YOU," "YOUR," AND "END USER"), AGREE TO THESE 
SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND CREATE A BINDING CONTRACT 
BETWEEN YOU AND AVAYA INC. OR THE APPLICABLE AVAYA AFFILIATE ("AVAYA"). 
IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY 
OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND 
SUCH ENTITY TO THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH 
AUTHORITY OR DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS, YOU 
MUST RETURN OR DELETE THE SOFTWARE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF DELIVERY FOR A 
REFUND OF THE FEE, IF ANY, YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSE OR IF SOFTWARE IS 
ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THESE 
SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS OR THE EQUIVALENT OPTION.

A. Definitions

(i) "Affiliate" means any entity that is directly or indirectly 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Avaya Inc. or 
End User. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the power to 
direct the management and policies of such party, directly or indirectly, 
whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; 
and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to 
the foregoing. 

(ii) "Documentation" means information published in varying mediums which 
may include product information, operating instructions and performance 
specifications that are generally made available to users of products. 
Documentation does not include marketing materials. 

(iii) "Software" means  computer programs in object code, provided by 
Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, whether as stand-alone products or 
pre-installed on hardware products, and any upgrades, updates, patches, 
bug fixes, or modified versions thereto.

B. Scope. These Software License Terms are applicable to anyone who 
installs, downloads, and/or uses Software and/or Documentation, obtained 
from Avaya or an Avaya reseller, distributor, direct partner, system 
integrator, service provider or other partner authorized to provide 
Software to End Users in the applicable territory ( collectively "Avaya 
Channel Partner"). Some or all of the Software may be remotely hosted or 
accessible to You through the Internet. You are not authorized to use the 
Software if the Software was obtained from anyone other than Avaya or an 
Avaya Channel Partner.
 
These Software License Terms govern Your use of the Software and/ or 
Documentation except to the extent: (i) You are obtaining the Software 
directly from Avaya and You have a separate, written agreement with Avaya 
governing Your use of the Software, signed within three (3) years of the 
purchase of the applicable Software license, (ii) You are obtaining the 
Software from an Avaya Channel Partner and You have a separate, written 
agreement with Avaya governing Your use of Software obtained from that 
Avaya Channel Partner, signed within three (3) years of the purchase of 
the applicable Software license, (iii) the Software is accompanied by a 
Shrinkwrap License, or (iv) the Software is governed by Third Party 
Terms. If You have a separate signed purchase agreement with Avaya, as 
set forth in (i) or (ii) above, such agreement shall take precedence over 
these Software License Terms to the extent of any conflict. With respect 
to third party elements subject to a Shrinkwrap License or other Third 
Party Terms, the Shrinkwrap License or other Third Party Terms shall take 
precedence over any signed agreement with Avaya and these Software 
License Terms to the extent of any conflict. 

C. License Grant. Avaya grants You a personal, non-sublicensable, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Software and associated 
Documentation obtained from Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, and for 
which applicable fees have been paid, for Your internal business purposes 
at the indicated capacity and features and within the scope of the 
applicable license types described below and at locations where the 
Software is initially installed. Licenses provided under this Agreement 
are for a perpetual duration, unless (i) otherwise specified in the order 
or (ii) the license is provided as part of a service or subscription, in 
which case the license grant will be limited to the duration specified on 
the order or in the service or subscription Documentation. Documentation 
shall be used only in support of the authorized use of the associated 
Software. Software installed on mobile-devices and clients, such as a 
laptop or mobile phone, may be used outside of the country where the 
Software was originally installed, provided that such use is on a 
temporary basis only.(i) Right to Move License Entitlements. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation permitting use of the Software 
only at the location where it is initially installed, You may move 
eligible right to use license entitlements ("RTU") for certain specified 
Software from one location to another in accordance with Avaya's 
then-current software license portability policy ("License Portability 
Policy"), which License Portability Policy is available upon request, 
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section C (i):

	(a) You shall provide written notice within ten (10) days to Avaya of 
		any RTU moves including but not limited to, the number and type of 
		licenses moved, the location of the original Server and the location 
		of the new Server, the date of such RTU moves and any other 
		information that Avaya may reasonably request; 

	(b) You  may only move RTU's to and from Designated Processors or 
		Servers supporting the same Software application;

	(c) You must reduce the quantity of the licenses on the original 
		Server by the number of RTU's being moved to the new Server;

	(d) You acknowledge that: (1) You may be charged additional fees when 
		moving RTU's as per Avaya's then-current License Portability Policy, 
		(2) maintenance services do not cover system errors caused by moves 
		not performed by Avaya, (3) You are responsible for any programming, 
		administration, design assurance, translation or other activity to 
		make sure the Software will scale and perform as specified as a 
		result of any license moves, and if any such transfer results in a 
		requirement for Avaya system engineering or requires the use of 
		on-site Avaya personnel, You will be charged the Time and Materials 
		fees for such activity; 

	(e) If Your maintenance coverage differs on licenses on the same 
		product instance at the location of the new Server, service updates, 
		recasts and/or fees may apply and any fee adjustments for differences 
		in coverage will only be made on a going forward basis as of the date 
		Avaya receives notice of the RTU move; and

	(f) You may move RTU's from one Affiliate to another Affiliate 
		provided that You comply with all of the conditions of this Section, 
		including, without limitation, providing the name and address of the 
		new Affiliate in Your written notice under subpart (a) above, and 
		provided such new Affiliate agrees to be bound by these Software 
		License Terms. 

(ii) Non-Production License Grant. With respect to Software distributed 
by Avaya to You for non-production purposes, the scope of the license 
granted herein shall be to use the Software in a non-production 
environment solely for testing or other non-commercial purposes on a 
single computer or as otherwise designated by Avaya ("Non-Production 
License").

D. All Rights Reserved. Avaya or its licensors retain title to and 
ownership of the Software, Documentation, and any modifications or copies 
thereof. Except for the limited license rights expressly granted in these 
Software License Terms, Avaya or its licensors reserve all rights, 
including without limitation copyright, patent, trade secret, and all 
other intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and 
Documentation and any modifications or copies thereof. The Software 
contains trade secrets of Avaya, its suppliers, or licensors, including 
but not limited to the specific design, structure and logic of individual 
Software programs, their interactions with other portions of the 
Software, both internal and external, and the programming techniques 
employed.

E. General License Restrictions. To the extent permissible under 
applicable law, You agree not to: (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse 
engineer, reverse translate or in any other manner decode the Software; 
(ii) alter, modifandy or create any derivative works or enhancements, 
adaptations, or translations of the Software or Documentation; (iii) 
sell, sublicense, lease, rent, loan, assign, convey or otherwise transfer 
the Software or Documentation except as expressly authorized by Avaya in 
writing, and any attempt to do so is void; (iv) distribute, disclose or 
allow use of the Software or Documentation, in any format, through any 
timesharing service, service bureau, network or by any other similar 
means, such as hosting or cloud, except as expressly authorized by Avaya 
in writing; (v) allow any service provider or other third party, with the 
exception of Avaya's authorized maintenance providers who are acting 
solely on behalf of and for the benefit of End User, to use or execute 
any software commands that facilitate the maintenance or repair of any 
product; (vi) gain access to or the use of any Software or part thereof 
without authorization from Avaya; (vii) enable or activate, or cause, 
permit or allow others to enable or activate any logins reserved for use 
by Avaya or Avaya's authorized maintenance providers; (viii) publish the 
results of any tests run on the Software; (ix) disclose, provide, or 
otherwise make available to any third party any trade secrets contained 
in the Software or Documentation; (x) use the Software in a virtualized 
environment except as expressly authorized by these Software License 
Terms, or (xi) permit or encourage any third party to do any of the 
foregoing.

End User agrees not to allow anyone other than its authorized employees, 
agents or representatives who have a need to use the Software or 
Documentation to have access to the Software or Documentation. End User 
agrees to inform any third party to whom You give access to the Software 
or Documentation of these Software License Terms and shall obligate such 
third party to comply with such terms and provisions. End User shall be 
responsible for any third party's failure to comply with these Software 
License Terms and shall indemnify Avaya for any damages, loss, expenses 
or costs, including attorneys' fees and costs of suit, incurred by Avaya 
as a result of non-compliance with this Section.

Additional License Restrictions Applicable to the EU. Notwithstanding the 
limitations in Sections C and E, solely to the extent an End User's 
resale rights cannot be precluded or restricted by mandatory applicable 
law, End Users located in a member state of the European Union may resell 
licenses subject to the following conditions:

	(i)   Prior to resale of a license, End User will promptly, but not 
		  less than 30 days prior to a resale, notify Avaya in writing of its 
		  intention to resell a license.

	(ii)  Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, End User will not 
		  be permitted to resell less than its entire license to a buyer.

	(iii) End User will resell the Software subject to these Software 
		  License Terms and shall  ensure that the buyer is bound by these 
		  Software License Terms.

	(iv)  Upon resale of a license, End User shall immediately and 
		  permanently cease all use of and destroy all copies of the Software 
		  and any related materials in End User's possession or control and, 
		  upon Avaya's request, certify such destruction in writing. Avaya may 
		  audit End User's compliance with the foregoing in accordance with 
		  Section J below.

	(v)   End User will keep appropriate records of all license resale 
		  including, but not limited to, the name and location of the buyer and 
		  the number and types of licenses resold. 

	(vi)  End User acknowledges that: (a) resale of a license is subject 
		  to any relevant Third Party Terms; (b) maintenance services do not 
		  cover system errors caused by license resale not performed by Avaya; 
		  (c) Avaya is not responsible for any programming, administration, 
		  design assurance, translation or other activity to make sure the 
		  Software will scale and perform as specified as a result of any 
		  license resale, and if any such resale results in a requirement for 
		  Avaya system engineering or requires the use of on-site Avaya 
		  personnel, End User will be charged the then applicable Avaya time 
		  and materials rates for such activity; (d) any resale of a 
		  maintenance services agreement between Avaya and the original 
		  licensee is subject to Avaya's prior written approval. Avaya reserves 
		  the right to withhold such approval and/or offer the new licensee a 
		  maintenance services agreement subject to different terms and 
		  conditions; and (e) if not expressly agreed by Avaya in writing 
		  otherwise, the resale of licenses does not entitle the End User to 
		  cancel or partially cancel a maintenance services agreement during 
		  the agreed term.

If the Software is rightfully located in a member state of the European 
Union and End User needs information about the Software in order to 
achieve interoperability of an independently created software program 
with the Software, End User will first request such information from 
Avaya. Avaya may charge End User a reasonable fee for the provision of 
such information. End User agrees to protect such information in 
accordance with Section P below, and shall use such information only in 
accordance with the terms and conditions under which Avaya provides such 
information. To the extent that the End User is expressly permitted by 
applicable mandatory law to undertake any activities related to achieving 
interoperability of an independently created software program with the 
Software, End User will not exercise those rights until End User has 
given Avaya twenty (20) days written notice of its intent to exercise any 
such rights.

F. Proprietary Rights Notices. You agree to retain, in the same form and 
location, all proprietary legends and/or logos of Avaya and/or Avaya's 
suppliers on any permitted copies of the Software or Documentation.

G. Backup Copies. End User may create a reasonable number of archival and 
backup copies of the Software and the Documentation.

H. Upgrades. End User's right to use any upgrades to the Software shall 
be conditioned upon End User having a valid license to use the original 
Software and paying the applicable license fee to Avaya or an Avaya 
Channel Partner for such upgrade.

I. Warranty. Avaya's Global Product Warranty Policy for End Users, which 
details a limited warranty for Software and Software media and the 
applicable procedures, exclusions, and disclaimers, is available through 
the following website: http://support.avaya.com, or such successor site 
as designated by Avaya. Please note that if You are acquiring the 
Software from an Avaya Channel Partner outside the United States of 
America or Canada, any warranty is provided to You by said Avaya Channel 
Partner and not by Avaya.

J. Compliance. Avaya and the Avaya Channel Partner who provided the 
Software have the right to inspect or audit by remote polling or other 
reasonable means, and to inspect End User's books, records, and accounts 
during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, to determine End 
User's compliance with these Software License Terms, including but not 
limited to usage levels. In the event such inspection or audit uncovers 
non-compliance with these Software License Terms, then without prejudice 
to Avaya's termination rights hereunder, End User shall promptly pay 
Avaya any applicable license fees. End User agrees to keep a current 
record of the location of the Software.

K. Termination of License; Effect of Termination/ Expiration. If You 
breach these Software License Terms and if within ten (10) business days 
of Avaya's written request to cure, You have not cured all breaches of 
license limitations or restrictions, Avaya may, with immediate effect, 
terminate the licenses granted in these Software License Terms without 
prejudice to any available rights and remedies Avaya may have at law or 
in equity. Upon termination or expiration of the license for any reason, 
You must immediately destroy all copies of the Software and any related 
materials in Your possession or control and, upon Avaya's request, 
certify such destruction in writing. The provisions concerning 
confidentiality, the protection of trade secrets and proprietary rights, 
license restrictions, export control, and all limitations of liability 
and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty (as well as any other terms 
which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination) will survive 
any termination or expiration of the Software License Terms.

L. License Types. Avaya grants You a license within the scope of the 
license types described below, with the exception of Heritage Nortel 
Software, for which the scope of the license is detailed in Section M 
below. Where the order documentation does not expressly identify a 
license type, the applicable license will be a Designated System License. 
The applicable number of licenses and units of capacity for which the 
license is granted will be one (1), unless a different number of licenses 
or units of capacity is specified in the documentation or other materials 
available to You. "Designated Processor" means a single stand-alone 
computing device. "Server" means a Designated Processor that hosts a 
software application to be accessed by multiple users. "Instance" means a 
single copy of the Software executing at a particular time: (i) on one 
physical machine; or (ii) on one deployed software virtual machine  or 
similar deployment.

	(i)   Designated System(s) License (DS). End User may install and use 
		  each copy or an Instance of the Software only on a number of 
		  Designated Processors up to the number indicated in the order. Avaya 
		  may require the Designated Processor(s) to be identified in the order 
		  by type, serial number, feature key, Instance, location or other 
		  specific designation, or to be provided by End User to Avaya through 
		  electronic means established by Avaya specifically for this purpose. 

	(ii)  Concurrent User License (CU). End User may install and use the 
		  Software on multiple Designated Processors or one or more Servers, so 
		  long as only the licensed number of Units are accessing and using the 
		  Software at any given time. A "Unit" means the unit on which Avaya, 
		  at its sole discretion, bases the pricing of its licenses and can be, 
		  without limitation, an agent, port or user, an e-mail or voice mail 
		  account in the name of a person or corporate function (e.g., 
		  webmaster or helpdesk), or a directory entry in the administrative 
		  database utilized by the Software that permits one user to interface 
		  with the Software. Units may be linked to a specific, identified 
		  Server or an Instance of the Software.

	(iii) Database License (DL). End User may install and use each copy 
		  or an Instance of the Software on one Server or on multiple Servers 
		  provided that each of the Servers on which the Software is installed 
		  communicates with no more than one Instance of the same database. 

	(iv)  CPU License (CP). End User may install and use each copy or 
		  Instance of the Software on a number of Servers up to the number 
		  indicated in the order provided that the performance capacity of the 
		  Server(s) does not exceed the performance capacity specified for the 
		  Software. End User may not re-install or operate the Software on 
		  Server(s) with a larger performance capacity without Avaya's prior 
		  consent and payment of an upgrade fee. 

	(v)   Named User License (NU). You may: (i) install and use the 
		  Software on a single Designated Processor or Server per authorized 
		  Named User (defined below); or (ii) install and use the Software on a 
		  Server so long as only authorized Named Users access and use the 
		  Software. "Named User," means a user or device that has been 
		  expressly authorized by Avaya to access and use the Software. At 
		  Avaya's sole discretion, a "Named User" may be, without limitation, 
		  designated by name, corporate function (e.g., webmaster or helpdesk), 
		  an e-mail or voice mail account in the name of a person or corporate 
		  function, or a directory entry in the administrative database 
		  utilized by the Software that permits one user to interface with the 
		  Software. 

	(vi)  Shrinkwrap License (SR). You may install and use the Software in 
		  accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable license 
		  agreements, such as "shrinkwrap" or "clickthrough" license 
		  accompanying or applicable to the Software ("Shrinkwrap License").

M. Heritage Nortel Software. "Heritage Nortel Software" means the 
Software that was acquired by Avaya as part of its purchase of the Nortel 
Enterprise Solutions Business in December 2009. The Heritage Nortel 
Software currently available for license from Avaya is the Software 
contained within the list of Heritage Nortel Products located at 
http://support.avaya.com/LicenseInfo under the link "Heritage Nortel 
Products", or such successor site as designated by Avaya. For Heritage 
Nortel Software, Avaya grants You a license to use Heritage Nortel 
Software provided hereunder solely to the extent of the authorized 
activation or authorized usage level, solely for the purpose specified in 
the Documentation, and solely as embedded in, for execution on, or for 
communication with Avaya equipment. Charges for Heritage Nortel Software 
may be based on extent of activation or use authorized as specified in an 
order or invoice. 

N. Third Party Components. Certain software programs or portions thereof 
included in the Software may contain software (including open source 
software) distributed under third party agreements ("Third Party 
Components"), which contain terms regarding the rights to use certain 
portions of the Software ("Third Party Terms"). As required, information 
regarding distributed Linux OS source code (for those Products that have 
distributed Linux OS source code) and identifying the copyright holders 
of the Third Party Components and the Third Party Terms that apply is 
available in the Products, Documentation or on Avaya's website at: 
http://support.avaya.com/Copyright, or such successor site as designated 
by Avaya. You agree to the Third Party Terms for any such Third Party 
Components.

O. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS OR WILLFUL 
MISCONDUCT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER 
AVAYA, AVAYA AFFILIATES, THEIR LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, NOR ANY OF THEIR 
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, STATUTORY, INDIRECT OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (ii) ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, TOLL 
FRAUD, OR COST OF COVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR PERFORMANCE, OR (iii) ANY 
DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS IN EXCESS OF 
THE FEES PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE TWELVE 
MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE. REGARDLESS 
OF WHETHER THEY WERE ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW 
OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIMITED REMEDIES 
FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS 
SECTION WILL APPLY TO ANY DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE.

P. Protection of Software and Documentation. End User acknowledges that 
the Software and Documentation are confidential information of Avaya and 
its suppliers and contain trade secrets of Avaya and its suppliers. End 
User agrees at all times to protect and preserve in strict confidence the 
Software and Documentation using no less than the level of care End User 
uses to protect its own information of a confidential nature and to 
implement reasonable security measures to protect the trade secrets of 
Avaya and its suppliers. 

Q. Personal Data. Your privacy is important to Avaya. Avaya's data 
privacy policy can be found at 
http://investors.avaya.com/governance/data_privacy.asp, or such successor 
site as designated by Avaya. The download or use of the Software may 
require the processing of personal data (including, but not limited to

V. Miscellaneous. These Software License Terms and any dispute, claim or 
controversy arising out of or relating to these Software License Terms 
("Dispute"), including without limitation those relating to the 
formation, interpretation, breach or termination of these Software 
License Terms, or any issue regarding whether a Dispute is subject to 
arbitration under these Software License Terms, will be governed by New 
York State laws, excluding conflict of law principles, and the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
 
Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the following 
provisions. The disputing party shall give the other party written notice 
of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve each 
Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longer period as the 
parties may mutually agree, following the delivery of such notice, by 
negotiations between designated representatives of the parties who have 
dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than 
in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed 
anywhere other than in the United States cannot be settled under these 
procedures and within these timeframes, it will be conclusively 
determined upon request of either party by a final and binding 
arbitration proceeding to be held in accordance with the Rules of 
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single 
arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an 
arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of 
Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross 
claims and counterclaims by any one party against any or all other 
parties exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including 
cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in 
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of 
Commerce by a panel of three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with 
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The 
arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location 
agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the 
arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to award 
compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of these 
Software License Terms and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. 
The arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or 
otherwise modify the terms of these Software License Terms. The ruling by 
the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be 
entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their 
assets. The parties will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)' 
fees, but each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs 
associated with the arbitration. The parties, their representatives, 
other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content 
and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent 
permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and results of 
the arbitration shall be as limited and narrowed as required to comply 
with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law 
mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award 
only, the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be 
disclosed.
 
If a Dispute by one party against the other that arose in the United 
States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States 
cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth 
above, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in 
either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
Except as otherwise stated above with regard to arbitration of Disputes 
that arise anywhere other than in the United States or are based upon an 
alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States, each 
party to these Software License Terms consents to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of those courts, including their appellate courts, for the 
purpose of all actions and proceedings.

The parties agree that the arbitration provision in this section may be 
enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security 
of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or 
order. Nothing in this section will be construed to preclude either party 
from seeking provisional remedies, including but not limited to temporary 
restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of 
competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its 
rights pending arbitration, at any time. In addition and notwithstanding 
the foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take any necessary legal action 
at any time, including without limitation seeking immediate injunctive 
relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect 
Avaya's intellectual property and its confidential or proprietary 
information (including but not limited to trade secrets).

If any provision of these Software License Terms is determined to be 
unenforceable or invalid, these Software License Terms will not be 
rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and the provision will be 
changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the 
original provision within the limits of applicable law. The failure to 
assert any rights under the Software License Terms, including, but not 
limited to, the right to terminate in the event of breach or default, 
will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each 
and every provision of the Software License Terms in accordance with 
their terms. If you move any Software, and as a result of such move, a 
jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including withholding 
taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any 
such Software), then you are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any 
such duty, taxes, levy or other fees. 

W. Agreement in English. The parties confirm that it is their wish that 
these Software License Terms, as well as all other documents relating 
hereto, including all notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the 
English language only. Les parties aux présentes confirment leur volonté 
que cette convention, de même que tous les documents, y compris tout 
avis, qui s'y rattachent, soient rédigés en langue anglaise.</License>

REVISED:  March 2015

THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS") GOVERNS THE 
USE OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE LICENSED 
THROUGH AVAYA. READ THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS CAREFULLY, IN THEIR 
ENTIRETY, BEFORE INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SOFTWARE (AS 
DEFINED IN SECTION A BELOW). BY INSTALLING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE 
SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZING OTHERS TO DO SO, YOU, ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF AND 
THE ENTITY FOR WHOM YOU ARE DOING SO (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO 
INTERCHANGEABLY AS "YOU," "YOUR," AND "END USER"), AGREE TO THESE 
SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND CREATE A BINDING CONTRACT 
BETWEEN YOU AND AVAYA INC. OR THE APPLICABLE AVAYA AFFILIATE ("AVAYA"). 
IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY 
OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND 
SUCH ENTITY TO THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH 
AUTHORITY OR DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS, YOU 
MUST RETURN OR DELETE THE SOFTWARE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF DELIVERY FOR A 
REFUND OF THE FEE, IF ANY, YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSE OR IF SOFTWARE IS 
ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE "DECLINE" BUTTON AT THE END OF THESE 
SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS OR THE EQUIVALENT OPTION.

A. Definitions

(i) "Affiliate" means any entity that is directly or indirectly 
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Avaya Inc. or 
End User. For purposes of this definition, "control" means the power to 
direct the management and policies of such party, directly or indirectly, 
whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; 
and the terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to 
the foregoing. 

(ii) "Documentation" means information published in varying mediums which 
may include product information, operating instructions and performance 
specifications that are generally made available to users of products. 
Documentation does not include marketing materials. 

(iii) "Software" means  computer programs in object code, provided by 
Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, whether as stand-alone products or 
pre-installed on hardware products, and any upgrades, updates, patches, 
bug fixes, or modified versions thereto.

B. Scope. These Software License Terms are applicable to anyone who 
installs, downloads, and/or uses Software and/or Documentation, obtained 
from Avaya or an Avaya reseller, distributor, direct partner, system 
integrator, service provider or other partner authorized to provide 
Software to End Users in the applicable territory ( collectively "Avaya 
Channel Partner"). Some or all of the Software may be remotely hosted or 
accessible to You through the Internet. You are not authorized to use the 
Software if the Software was obtained from anyone other than Avaya or an 
Avaya Channel Partner.
 
These Software License Terms govern Your use of the Software and/ or 
Documentation except to the extent: (i) You are obtaining the Software 
directly from Avaya and You have a separate, written agreement with Avaya 
governing Your use of the Software, signed within three (3) years of the 
purchase of the applicable Software license, (ii) You are obtaining the 
Software from an Avaya Channel Partner and You have a separate, written 
agreement with Avaya governing Your use of Software obtained from that 
Avaya Channel Partner, signed within three (3) years of the purchase of 
the applicable Software license, (iii) the Software is accompanied by a 
Shrinkwrap License, or (iv) the Software is governed by Third Party 
Terms. If You have a separate signed purchase agreement with Avaya, as 
set forth in (i) or (ii) above, such agreement shall take precedence over 
these Software License Terms to the extent of any conflict. With respect 
to third party elements subject to a Shrinkwrap License or other Third 
Party Terms, the Shrinkwrap License or other Third Party Terms shall take 
precedence over any signed agreement with Avaya and these Software 
License Terms to the extent of any conflict. 

C. License Grant. Avaya grants You a personal, non-sublicensable, 
non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Software and associated 
Documentation obtained from Avaya or an Avaya Channel Partner, and for 
which applicable fees have been paid, for Your internal business purposes 
at the indicated capacity and features and within the scope of the 
applicable license types described below and at locations where the 
Software is initially installed. Licenses provided under this Agreement 
are for a perpetual duration, unless (i) otherwise specified in the order 
or (ii) the license is provided as part of a service or subscription, in 
which case the license grant will be limited to the duration specified on 
the order or in the service or subscription Documentation. Documentation 
shall be used only in support of the authorized use of the associated 
Software. Software installed on mobile-devices and clients, such as a 
laptop or mobile phone, may be used outside of the country where the 
Software was originally installed, provided that such use is on a 
temporary basis only.(i) Right to Move License Entitlements. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation permitting use of the Software 
only at the location where it is initially installed, You may move 
eligible right to use license entitlements ("RTU") for certain specified 
Software from one location to another in accordance with Avaya's 
then-current software license portability policy ("License Portability 
Policy"), which License Portability Policy is available upon request, 
subject to the conditions set forth in this Section C (i):

	(a) You shall provide written notice within ten (10) days to Avaya of 
		any RTU moves including but not limited to, the number and type of 
		licenses moved, the location of the original Server and the location 
		of the new Server, the date of such RTU moves and any other 
		information that Avaya may reasonably request; 

	(b) You  may only move RTU's to and from Designated Processors or 
		Servers supporting the same Software application;

	(c) You must reduce the quantity of the licenses on the original 
		Server by the number of RTU's being moved to the new Server;

	(d) You acknowledge that: (1) You may be charged additional fees when 
		moving RTU's as per Avaya's then-current License Portability Policy, 
		(2) maintenance services do not cover system errors caused by moves 
		not performed by Avaya, (3) You are responsible for any programming, 
		administration, design assurance, translation or other activity to 
		make sure the Software will scale and perform as specified as a 
		result of any license moves, and if any such transfer results in a 
		requirement for Avaya system engineering or requires the use of 
		on-site Avaya personnel, You will be charged the Time and Materials 
		fees for such activity; 

	(e) If Your maintenance coverage differs on licenses on the same 
		product instance at the location of the new Server, service updates, 
		recasts and/or fees may apply and any fee adjustments for differences 
		in coverage will only be made on a going forward basis as of the date 
		Avaya receives notice of the RTU move; and

	(f) You may move RTU's from one Affiliate to another Affiliate 
		provided that You comply with all of the conditions of this Section, 
		including, without limitation, providing the name and address of the 
		new Affiliate in Your written notice under subpart (a) above, and 
		provided such new Affiliate agrees to be bound by these Software 
		License Terms. 

(ii) Non-Production License Grant. With respect to Software distributed 
by Avaya to You for non-production purposes, the scope of the license 
granted herein shall be to use the Software in a non-production 
environment solely for testing or other non-commercial purposes on a 
single computer or as otherwise designated by Avaya ("Non-Production 
License").

D. All Rights Reserved. Avaya or its licensors retain title to and 
ownership of the Software, Documentation, and any modifications or copies 
thereof. Except for the limited license rights expressly granted in these 
Software License Terms, Avaya or its licensors reserve all rights, 
including without limitation copyright, patent, trade secret, and all 
other intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and 
Documentation and any modifications or copies thereof. The Software 
contains trade secrets of Avaya, its suppliers, or licensors, including 
but not limited to the specific design, structure and logic of individual 
Software programs, their interactions with other portions of the 
Software, both internal and external, and the programming techniques 
employed.

E. General License Restrictions. To the extent permissible under 
applicable law, You agree not to: (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse 
engineer, reverse translate or in any other manner decode the Software; 
(ii) alter, modifandy or create any derivative works or enhancements, 
adaptations, or translations of the Software or Documentation; (iii) 
sell, sublicense, lease, rent, loan, assign, convey or otherwise transfer 
the Software or Documentation except as expressly authorized by Avaya in 
writing, and any attempt to do so is void; (iv) distribute, disclose or 
allow use of the Software or Documentation, in any format, through any 
timesharing service, service bureau, network or by any other similar 
means, such as hosting or cloud, except as expressly authorized by Avaya 
in writing; (v) allow any service provider or other third party, with the 
exception of Avaya's authorized maintenance providers who are acting 
solely on behalf of and for the benefit of End User, to use or execute 
any software commands that facilitate the maintenance or repair of any 
product; (vi) gain access to or the use of any Software or part thereof 
without authorization from Avaya; (vii) enable or activate, or cause, 
permit or allow others to enable or activate any logins reserved for use 
by Avaya or Avaya's authorized maintenance providers; (viii) publish the 
results of any tests run on the Software; (ix) disclose, provide, or 
otherwise make available to any third party any trade secrets contained 
in the Software or Documentation; (x) use the Software in a virtualized 
environment except as expressly authorized by these Software License 
Terms, or (xi) permit or encourage any third party to do any of the 
foregoing.

End User agrees not to allow anyone other than its authorized employees, 
agents or representatives who have a need to use the Software or 
Documentation to have access to the Software or Documentation. End User 
agrees to inform any third party to whom You give access to the Software 
or Documentation of these Software License Terms and shall obligate such 
third party to comply with such terms and provisions. End User shall be 
responsible for any third party's failure to comply with these Software 
License Terms and shall indemnify Avaya for any damages, loss, expenses 
or costs, including attorneys' fees and costs of suit, incurred by Avaya 
as a result of non-compliance with this Section.

Additional License Restrictions Applicable to the EU. Notwithstanding the 
limitations in Sections C and E, solely to the extent an End User's 
resale rights cannot be precluded or restricted by mandatory applicable 
law, End Users located in a member state of the European Union may resell 
licenses subject to the following conditions:

	(i)   Prior to resale of a license, End User will promptly, but not 
		  less than 30 days prior to a resale, notify Avaya in writing of its 
		  intention to resell a license.

	(ii)  Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing, End User will not 
		  be permitted to resell less than its entire license to a buyer.

	(iii) End User will resell the Software subject to these Software 
		  License Terms and shall  ensure that the buyer is bound by these 
		  Software License Terms.

	(iv)  Upon resale of a license, End User shall immediately and 
		  permanently cease all use of and destroy all copies of the Software 
		  and any related materials in End User's possession or control and, 
		  upon Avaya's request, certify such destruction in writing. Avaya may 
		  audit End User's compliance with the foregoing in accordance with 
		  Section J below.

	(v)   End User will keep appropriate records of all license resale 
		  including, but not limited to, the name and location of the buyer and 
		  the number and types of licenses resold. 

	(vi)  End User acknowledges that: (a) resale of a license is subject 
		  to any relevant Third Party Terms; (b) maintenance services do not 
		  cover system errors caused by license resale not performed by Avaya; 
		  (c) Avaya is not responsible for any programming, administration, 
		  design assurance, translation or other activity to make sure the 
		  Software will scale and perform as specified as a result of any 
		  license resale, and if any such resale results in a requirement for 
		  Avaya system engineering or requires the use of on-site Avaya 
		  personnel, End User will be charged the then applicable Avaya time 
		  and materials rates for such activity; (d) any resale of a 
		  maintenance services agreement between Avaya and the original 
		  licensee is subject to Avaya's prior written approval. Avaya reserves 
		  the right to withhold such approval and/or offer the new licensee a 
		  maintenance services agreement subject to different terms and 
		  conditions; and (e) if not expressly agreed by Avaya in writing 
		  otherwise, the resale of licenses does not entitle the End User to 
		  cancel or partially cancel a maintenance services agreement during 
		  the agreed term.

If the Software is rightfully located in a member state of the European 
Union and End User needs information about the Software in order to 
achieve interoperability of an independently created software program 
with the Software, End User will first request such information from 
Avaya. Avaya may charge End User a reasonable fee for the provision of 
such information. End User agrees to protect such information in 
accordance with Section P below, and shall use such information only in 
accordance with the terms and conditions under which Avaya provides such 
information. To the extent that the End User is expressly permitted by 
applicable mandatory law to undertake any activities related to achieving 
interoperability of an independently created software program with the 
Software, End User will not exercise those rights until End User has 
given Avaya twenty (20) days written notice of its intent to exercise any 
such rights.

F. Proprietary Rights Notices. You agree to retain, in the same form and 
location, all proprietary legends and/or logos of Avaya and/or Avaya's 
suppliers on any permitted copies of the Software or Documentation.

G. Backup Copies. End User may create a reasonable number of archival and 
backup copies of the Software and the Documentation.

H. Upgrades. End User's right to use any upgrades to the Software shall 
be conditioned upon End User having a valid license to use the original 
Software and paying the applicable license fee to Avaya or an Avaya 
Channel Partner for such upgrade.

I. Warranty. Avaya's Global Product Warranty Policy for End Users, which 
details a limited warranty for Software and Software media and the 
applicable procedures, exclusions, and disclaimers, is available through 
the following website: http://support.avaya.com, or such successor site 
as designated by Avaya. Please note that if You are acquiring the 
Software from an Avaya Channel Partner outside the United States of 
America or Canada, any warranty is provided to You by said Avaya Channel 
Partner and not by Avaya.

J. Compliance. Avaya and the Avaya Channel Partner who provided the 
Software have the right to inspect or audit by remote polling or other 
reasonable means, and to inspect End User's books, records, and accounts 
during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, to determine End 
User's compliance with these Software License Terms, including but not 
limited to usage levels. In the event such inspection or audit uncovers 
non-compliance with these Software License Terms, then without prejudice 
to Avaya's termination rights hereunder, End User shall promptly pay 
Avaya any applicable license fees. End User agrees to keep a current 
record of the location of the Software.

K. Termination of License; Effect of Termination/ Expiration. If You 
breach these Software License Terms and if within ten (10) business days 
of Avaya's written request to cure, You have not cured all breaches of 
license limitations or restrictions, Avaya may, with immediate effect, 
terminate the licenses granted in these Software License Terms without 
prejudice to any available rights and remedies Avaya may have at law or 
in equity. Upon termination or expiration of the license for any reason, 
You must immediately destroy all copies of the Software and any related 
materials in Your possession or control and, upon Avaya's request, 
certify such destruction in writing. The provisions concerning 
confidentiality, the protection of trade secrets and proprietary rights, 
license restrictions, export control, and all limitations of liability 
and disclaimers and restrictions of warranty (as well as any other terms 
which, by their nature, are intended to survive termination) will survive 
any termination or expiration of the Software License Terms.

L. License Types. Avaya grants You a license within the scope of the 
license types described below, with the exception of Heritage Nortel 
Software, for which the scope of the license is detailed in Section M 
below. Where the order documentation does not expressly identify a 
license type, the applicable license will be a Designated System License. 
The applicable number of licenses and units of capacity for which the 
license is granted will be one (1), unless a different number of licenses 
or units of capacity is specified in the documentation or other materials 
available to You. "Designated Processor" means a single stand-alone 
computing device. "Server" means a Designated Processor that hosts a 
software application to be accessed by multiple users. "Instance" means a 
single copy of the Software executing at a particular time: (i) on one 
physical machine; or (ii) on one deployed software virtual machine  or 
similar deployment.

	(i)   Designated System(s) License (DS). End User may install and use 
		  each copy or an Instance of the Software only on a number of 
		  Designated Processors up to the number indicated in the order. Avaya 
		  may require the Designated Processor(s) to be identified in the order 
		  by type, serial number, feature key, Instance, location or other 
		  specific designation, or to be provided by End User to Avaya through 
		  electronic means established by Avaya specifically for this purpose. 

	(ii)  Concurrent User License (CU). End User may install and use the 
		  Software on multiple Designated Processors or one or more Servers, so 
		  long as only the licensed number of Units are accessing and using the 
		  Software at any given time. A "Unit" means the unit on which Avaya, 
		  at its sole discretion, bases the pricing of its licenses and can be, 
		  without limitation, an agent, port or user, an e-mail or voice mail 
		  account in the name of a person or corporate function (e.g., 
		  webmaster or helpdesk), or a directory entry in the administrative 
		  database utilized by the Software that permits one user to interface 
		  with the Software. Units may be linked to a specific, identified 
		  Server or an Instance of the Software.

	(iii) Database License (DL). End User may install and use each copy 
		  or an Instance of the Software on one Server or on multiple Servers 
		  provided that each of the Servers on which the Software is installed 
		  communicates with no more than one Instance of the same database. 

	(iv)  CPU License (CP). End User may install and use each copy or 
		  Instance of the Software on a number of Servers up to the number 
		  indicated in the order provided that the performance capacity of the 
		  Server(s) does not exceed the performance capacity specified for the 
		  Software. End User may not re-install or operate the Software on 
		  Server(s) with a larger performance capacity without Avaya's prior 
		  consent and payment of an upgrade fee. 

	(v)   Named User License (NU). You may: (i) install and use the 
		  Software on a single Designated Processor or Server per authorized 
		  Named User (defined below); or (ii) install and use the Software on a 
		  Server so long as only authorized Named Users access and use the 
		  Software. "Named User," means a user or device that has been 
		  expressly authorized by Avaya to access and use the Software. At 
		  Avaya's sole discretion, a "Named User" may be, without limitation, 
		  designated by name, corporate function (e.g., webmaster or helpdesk), 
		  an e-mail or voice mail account in the name of a person or corporate 
		  function, or a directory entry in the administrative database 
		  utilized by the Software that permits one user to interface with the 
		  Software. 

	(vi)  Shrinkwrap License (SR). You may install and use the Software in 
		  accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable license 
		  agreements, such as "shrinkwrap" or "clickthrough" license 
		  accompanying or applicable to the Software ("Shrinkwrap License").

M. Heritage Nortel Software. "Heritage Nortel Software" means the 
Software that was acquired by Avaya as part of its purchase of the Nortel 
Enterprise Solutions Business in December 2009. The Heritage Nortel 
Software currently available for license from Avaya is the Software 
contained within the list of Heritage Nortel Products located at 
http://support.avaya.com/LicenseInfo under the link "Heritage Nortel 
Products", or such successor site as designated by Avaya. For Heritage 
Nortel Software, Avaya grants You a license to use Heritage Nortel 
Software provided hereunder solely to the extent of the authorized 
activation or authorized usage level, solely for the purpose specified in 
the Documentation, and solely as embedded in, for execution on, or for 
communication with Avaya equipment. Charges for Heritage Nortel Software 
may be based on extent of activation or use authorized as specified in an 
order or invoice. 

N. Third Party Components. Certain software programs or portions thereof 
included in the Software may contain software (including open source 
software) distributed under third party agreements ("Third Party 
Components"), which contain terms regarding the rights to use certain 
portions of the Software ("Third Party Terms"). As required, information 
regarding distributed Linux OS source code (for those Products that have 
distributed Linux OS source code) and identifying the copyright holders 
of the Third Party Components and the Third Party Terms that apply is 
available in the Products, Documentation or on Avaya's website at: 
http://support.avaya.com/Copyright, or such successor site as designated 
by Avaya. You agree to the Third Party Terms for any such Third Party 
Components.

O. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS OR WILLFUL 
MISCONDUCT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER 
AVAYA, AVAYA AFFILIATES, THEIR LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS, NOR ANY OF THEIR 
DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR (i) ANY 
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, STATUTORY, INDIRECT OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (ii) ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, TOLL 
FRAUD, OR COST OF COVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR PERFORMANCE, OR (iii) ANY 
DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING UNDER THESE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS IN EXCESS OF 
THE FEES PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM IN THE TWELVE 
MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE. REGARDLESS 
OF WHETHER THEY WERE ADVISED, HAD OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT KNEW 
OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIMITED REMEDIES 
FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS 
SECTION WILL APPLY TO ANY DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED, AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE.

P. Protection of Software and Documentation. End User acknowledges that 
the Software and Documentation are confidential information of Avaya and 
its suppliers and contain trade secrets of Avaya and its suppliers. End 
User agrees at all times to protect and preserve in strict confidence the 
Software and Documentation using no less than the level of care End User 
uses to protect its own information of a confidential nature and to 
implement reasonable security measures to protect the trade secrets of 
Avaya and its suppliers. 

Q. Personal Data. Your privacy is important to Avaya. Avaya's data 
privacy policy can be found at 
http://investors.avaya.com/governance/data_privacy.asp, or such successor 
site as designated by Avaya. The download or use of the Software may 
require the processing of personal data (including, but not limited to 
contact name, company address, company phone or fax, or company email) 
pertaining to Your company or to Your company's personnel. Such data will 
be used by Avaya for communication, administrative, and operational 
purposes related to the Software, including but not limited to tracking 
Software activations, communicating regarding trouble tickets and alarms, 
and providing Software updates. Personal data required to download or use 
the Software must be submitted to Avaya. Failing the submission of such 
data, the download or use of the Software may not be possible. You or 
Your personnel have a right to access and correct erroneous personal data 
pertaining to You or Your personnel and to object for legitimate reasons 
to the processing and transfer of this data. You can exercise this right 
by contacting in writing the Data Privacy Officer of the applicable Avaya 
Affiliate. 

R. High Risk Activities. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not 
designed, manufactured or intended for any use in any environment that 
requires fail-safe performance in which the failure of the Software could 
lead to death, personal injury or significant property damage ("High Risk 
Activities"). Such environments include, among others, control systems in 
a nuclear, chemical, biological or other hazardous facility, aircraft 
navigation and communications, air traffic control, and life support 
systems in a healthcare facility. End User assumes the risks for its use 
of the Software in any such High Risk Activities.

S. Import/Export Control. End User is advised that the Software is of 
U.S. origin and subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations 
("EAR"). The Software also may be subject to applicable local country 
import/export laws and regulations. Diversion contrary to U.S. and/ or 
applicable local country law and/ or regulation is prohibited. You agree 
not to directly or indirectly export, re-export, import, download, or 
transmit the Software to any country, end user or for any use that is 
contrary to applicable U.S. and/ or local country regulation or statute 
(including but not limited to those countries embargoed by the U.S. 
government). You represent that any  governmental agency has not issued 
sanctions against the End User or otherwise suspended, revoked or denied 
End User's import/export privileges. You agree not to use or transfer the 
Software for any use relating to nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, 
or missile technology, unless authorized by the U.S. and or any 
applicable local government by regulation or specific written license.

U. Acknowledgement. End User acknowledges that certain Software may 
contain programming that: (i) restricts, limits and/or disables access to 
certain features, functionality or capacity of such Software subject to

V. Miscellaneous. These Software License Terms and any dispute, claim or 
controversy arising out of or relating to these Software License Terms 
("Dispute"), including without limitation those relating to the 
formation, interpretation, breach or termination of these Software 
License Terms, or any issue regarding whether a Dispute is subject to 
arbitration under these Software License Terms, will be governed by New 
York State laws, excluding conflict of law principles, and the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
 
Any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the following 
provisions. The disputing party shall give the other party written notice 
of the Dispute. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve each 
Dispute within thirty (30) days, or such other longer period as the 
parties may mutually agree, following the delivery of such notice, by 
negotiations between designated representatives of the parties who have 
dispute resolution authority. If a Dispute that arose anywhere other than 
in the United States or is based upon an alleged breach committed 
anywhere other than in the United States cannot be settled under these 
procedures and within these timeframes, it will be conclusively 
determined upon request of either party by a final and binding 
arbitration proceeding to be held in accordance with the Rules of 
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by a single 
arbitrator appointed by the parties or (failing agreement) by an 
arbitrator appointed by the President of the International Chamber of 
Commerce (from time to time), except that if the aggregate claims, cross 
claims and counterclaims by any one party against any or all other 
parties exceed One Million US Dollars at the time all claims, including 
cross claims and counterclaims are filed, the proceeding will be held in 
accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of 
Commerce by a panel of three arbitrator(s) appointed in accordance with 
the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The 
arbitration will be conducted in the English language, at a location 
agreed by the parties or (failing agreement) ordered by the 
arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will have authority only to award 
compensatory damages within the scope of the limitations of these 
Software License Terms and will not award punitive or exemplary damages. 
The arbitrator(s) will not have the authority to limit, expand or 
otherwise modify the terms of these Software License Terms. The ruling by 
the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on the parties and may be 
entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or any of their 
assets. The parties will evenly split the cost of the arbitrator(s)' 
fees, but each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs 
associated with the arbitration. The parties, their representatives, 
other participants and the arbitrator(s) will hold the existence, content 
and results of the arbitration in strict confidence to the fullest extent 
permitted by law. Any disclosure of the existence, content and results of 
the arbitration shall be as limited and narrowed as required to comply 
with the applicable law. By way of illustration, if the applicable law 
mandates the disclosure of the monetary amount of an arbitration award 
only, the underlying opinion or rationale for that award may not be 
disclosed.
 
If a Dispute by one party against the other that arose in the United 
States or is based upon an alleged breach committed in the United States 
cannot be settled under the procedures and within the timeframe set forth 
above, then either party may bring an action or proceeding solely in 
either the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, or 
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
Except as otherwise stated above with regard to arbitration of Disputes 
that arise anywhere other than in the United States or are based upon an 
alleged breach committed anywhere other than in the United States, each 
party to these Software License Terms consents to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of those courts, including their appellate courts, for the 
purpose of all actions and proceedings.

The parties agree that the arbitration provision in this section may be 
enforced by injunction or other equitable order, and no bond or security 
of any kind will be required with respect to any such injunction or 
order. Nothing in this section will be construed to preclude either party 
from seeking provisional remedies, including but not limited to temporary 
restraining orders and preliminary injunctions from any court of 
competent jurisdiction in order to protect its rights, including its 
rights pending arbitration, at any time. In addition and notwithstanding 
the foregoing, Avaya shall be entitled to take any necessary legal action 
at any time, including without limitation seeking immediate injunctive 
relief from a court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect 
Avaya's intellectual property and its confidential or proprietary 
information (including but not limited to trade secrets).

If any provision of these Software License Terms is determined to be 
unenforceable or invalid, these Software License Terms will not be 
rendered unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and the provision will be 
changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the 
original provision within the limits of applicable law. The failure to 
assert any rights under the Software License Terms, including, but not 
limited to, the right to terminate in the event of breach or default, 
will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right to enforce each 
and every provision of the Software License Terms in accordance with 
their terms. If you move any Software, and as a result of such move, a 
jurisdiction imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee (including withholding 
taxes, fees, customs or other duties for the import and export of any 
such Software), then you are solely liable for, and agree to pay, any 
such duty, taxes, levy or other fees. 

W. Agreement in English. The parties confirm that it is their wish that 
these Software License Terms, as well as all other documents relating 
hereto, including all notices, have been and shall be drawn up in the 
English language only. Les parties aux présentes confirment leur volonté 
que cette convention, de même que tous les documents, y compris tout 
avis, qui s'y rattachent, soient rédigés en langue anglaise.</Msg>
